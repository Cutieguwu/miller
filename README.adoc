// Hello people reading the README source :)

== Prelude

For my stats course (4U Data Management) I have to interpret a bunch of data generated in class.
In an effort to not spend ages mindlessly using a calculator every summative check-in, I have started this project.

I figured, that since I already had to digitize every note, that I was required to make by hand, from during the game, that I might as well employ a format of my own. This format, would allow me to use code to interpret the monotonous mathematics for me. Even if I don't fully complete the code, it would ease the burden by completing some of the math for me.

== Goals

* [ ] Auto Ranking system?
* [ ] Data Visualizer?
* [ ] Dynamic Web Page?
* [ ] Pattern Analysis / Play Trend Analysis
** [ ] Most Frequent Play
** [ ] Least Frequent Play
** [ ] Most Effective Play (Greatest Terrain Gain on average)
** [ ] Most frequent play set.
** [ ] Repeating play pattern.
** [ ] Slow after score.
** [ ] Bias to using Play Actions
** [ ] Bias to using Runs
