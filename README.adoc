== Prelude

For my stats course (4U Data Management) I have to interpret a bunch of data generated in class.
In an effort to not spend ages mindlessly using a calculator every summative check-in, I have started this project.

I figured, that since I already had to digitize every note, that I was required to make by hand, from during the game, that I might as well employ a format of my own. This format, would allow me to use code to interpret the monotonous mathematics for me. Even if I don't fully complete the code, it would ease the burden by completing some of the math for me.
